## 📌 Singleton Pattern

### ✅ **Idea**

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance** throughout the lifetime of an application and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

### ✅ **When to Use**

* When exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
* When you need to restrict instantiation to a single instance for resource management (e.g., logging, configuration, thread pools).
